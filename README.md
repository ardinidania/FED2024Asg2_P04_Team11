Content 

- the content for this project was derived from the MokeSell case study, which required us to design an interactive and fully functionable ecommerce website
- Our core objective was to create a consumer-to-consumer ecommerce platform with enhanced user experience. To achieve this, we structured the web application to include the following components:
User Account Management: Account registration, login, profile editing, and follow functionality
Listing Management: Sellers can create, update, and promote listings with a limit of 30 active listings
Search and Browsing: Search by keywords and category browsing
Communication Tools: Integrated chat functionality to connect buyers and sellers
Feedback and Ratings: Transaction-based review system for building user trust
We developed content based on extensive research into current trends in eCommerce platforms, focusing on enhancing usability and interactivity through APIs, animations, and intuitive design elements.
